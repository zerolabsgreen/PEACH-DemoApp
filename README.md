# PEACH-Demo App


[PEACH](https://github.com/zerolabsgreen/PEACH-DataModel) is a Protocol for Environmental Attribute Certificate Harmonization, an open-source, universal data model for Environmental Attribute Certificates (EACs) that brings order to the complexity of sustainability claims across renewable energy, low-carbon fuels, carbon credits and more. 

This repository is the companion app demo to the **PEACH Data Model**: https://github.com/zerolabsgreen/PEACH-DataModel
